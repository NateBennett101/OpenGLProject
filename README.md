# OpenGLProject

My approach to designing software is a lot of trial and error. New skills that I've learned from this project are how to use OpenGL, and how to apply textures, lighting, and shaders in a scene. A design process that I might have followed is to collect the project requirements, start creating a prototype, then test my code. I think that my design process is decently universal for most projects that I work on, it involves understanding what is expected, working though it, then polishing the work, and I think that this process can be applied to future work as well. Understand the requirements, plan the architecture, code incrementally, test extensively, and iterate based on user feedback when developing programs. Version control was something I started using for the 3D scene project to control complexity. Iteration had a key role in enhancing features and addressing bugs. Through turning points, my coding style altered, stressing modular design and effective algorithms. By encouraging problem-solving, logical thinking, and computational skills, computer science helps people achieve their goals. For academic purposes, computational graphics transmit visual communication and spatial thinking skills. They advance computer-aided simulations, UI/UX design, and data visualization professionally, bringing up a variety of job options.
